        <p>Hey there! My names Garrick! I'm an LCSC Web Development Major. I started going to LCSC as a computer science major when I 
        realized that web development would make me feel like I was actually making something! Not that computer science majors don't
        make things, I just wanted to make the end product that goes to the customer, which is why I moved to web development.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Fun Fact about Garrick:</strong> I took a trip to New York City the summer of 2017 as a graduation present from my 
        grandmother, heres a picture I took!</p>
